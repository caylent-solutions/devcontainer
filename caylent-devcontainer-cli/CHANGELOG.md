* fix(workflow): use temporary file approach for __init__.py update

- Replace problematic inline Python with temporary file approach
- Avoids complex shell quoting and f-string issues in GitHub Actions
- Creates temporary Python script, executes it, then removes it
- More reliable across different shell environments ([`90dcb2e`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/90dcb2eaf60d68209cd752cc1e662571cec6127c))

* fix(workflow): fix semantic-release version file synchronization

- Use semantic-release with --no-commit flag to update pyproject.toml and CHANGELOG.md
- Manually update __init__.py since semantic-release version_variable isn&#39;t working properly
- Add build artifact cleanup to prevent git workflow interference
- Fix version extraction to use pyproject.toml directly instead of step outputs
- Ensures all three version files (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CHANGELOG.md) are synchronized

This resolves the &#39;nothing to commit, working tree clean&#39; errors and ensures proper
branch â†’ PR â†’ merge â†’ tag workflow for releases. ([`229d0a7`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/229d0a7867d00b6a558094d291fb0706e0a1e362))

- Reset pyproject.toml version from 1.6.0 to 1.5.0
- Reset __init__.py __version__ from 1.6.0 to 1.5.0
- Reset CHANGELOG.md to start with v1.5.0 as latest version
- This resolves the mismatch between git tags (1.5.0) and version files (1.6.0)
- Now semantic-release can properly calculate 1.6.0 based on commits since 1.5.0 tag ([`7655573`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/765557359ac75ab66236ac01ddba511441aa688e))

* fix: semantic release v8 config (#64)

* 1.6.0

Automatically generated by python-semantic-release

* fix: update semantic-release to v8 configuration format and sync version files

- Update semantic-release config to use v8.x format with proper sections
- Fix version_variable -&gt; version_variables (array format required in v8)
- Add proper branch, changelog, remote, and publish configurations
- Sync __init__.py version to 1.6.0 to match pyproject.toml
- Include CHANGELOG.md formatting updates from semantic-release

This ensures semantic-release will update all three files (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CHANGELOG.md)
atomically in future releases, preventing &#39;nothing to commit&#39; issues in CI/CD workflows.

* fix: correct semantic-release v8 configuration syntax

- Use version_variable (singular) not version_variables (plural)
- Use version_toml as string not array
- Restore branch config at top level
- Remove over-complex nested sections that aren&#39;t needed
- Keep the essential configuration for updating all 3 files atomically

Co-authored-by: semantic-release &lt;semantic-release&gt; ([`1ea7bce`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/1ea7bcece8536dd661d0640c66ce376ce448c100))

* fix: resolve semantic-release version synchronization issues in CI/CDâ€¦ (#63)

* fix: resolve semantic-release version synchronization issues in CI/CD workflows

- Fix main-validation workflow to properly update all version files (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CHANGELOG.md)
- Use &#39;semantic_release version --no-push --no-vcs-release&#39; instead of just &#39;changelog&#39; command
- Add comprehensive version file commits to prevent version mismatches
- Replace manual version overrides in publish workflow with version consistency verification
- Update CHANGELOG.md to properly reflect current v1.5.0 release
- Ensures git tags point to commits with synchronized version files across all locations

This prevents the &#39;already released&#39; error by maintaining proper version file synchronization
and ensures semantic-release can correctly calculate next versions from commit history.

* fix: improve workflow comments and version parsing precision

- Clarify semantic-release comment to specify which files are updated (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CHANGELOG.md)
- Use line-start anchored regex for pyproject.toml version parsing to avoid false matches
- Add detailed comments explaining Python regex approach vs grep/sed limitations
- Ensures robust version detection that handles both quote types and prevents pattern conflicts

* fix: clean up trailing whitespace in publish workflow

- Remove trailing whitespace automatically fixed by pre-commit hooks
- Ensures consistent code formatting across workflow files ([`f593565`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/f593565c7fe563b0a6f6a4d5d5b0ade936ae3e60))

* fix: optimize PyPI publish workflow with comprehensive caching and enhanced semantic versioning (#62)

* optimize: add comprehensive caching to PyPI publish workflow

- Add system dependencies cache with intelligent dpkg restoration
- Add ASDF installation cache with conditional clone logic
- Add Python dependencies cache for pip and site-packages
- Implement cache hit detection and permission fixing
- Optimize workflow performance by ~2-3 minutes
- Reduce bandwidth usage and improve reliability

These caching optimizations mirror the strategy used in main-validation.yml
and provide significant performance improvements for both manual and
automatic PyPI publishing workflows.

* chore: remove redundant source command

* fix: expand conventional commit support with comprehensive type definitions

- Add support for &#39;security&#39; and &#39;revert&#39; commit types as patch triggers
- Add comprehensive conventional commit documentation to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Include examples and version bump mapping for all supported types
- Clarify major version bump procedures with BREAKING CHANGE examples

This enables better semantic versioning automation and provides clear
guidelines for contributors on commit message formatting.

* fix: improve cache key robustness across all GitHub workflows

- Replace hardcoded &#39;ubuntu-2404&#39; with dynamic runner.arch in cache keys
- Ensures cache compatibility across different GitHub runner architectures
- Affects publish.yml, pr-validation.yml, and main-validation.yml workflows
- Prevents potential cache misses when GitHub updates runner specifications

This addresses the mismatch between runs-on: ubuntu-24.04 and hardcoded
ubuntu-2404 in cache keys, making the caching strategy more resilient.

* security: improve cache directory permissions with principle of least privilege

- Replace overly permissive chmod -R 755 with granular permissions
- Set directories to 755 (executable/searchable) and files to 644 (read-only)
- Apply security improvements across all workflows: publish.yml, main-validation.yml, pr-validation.yml
- Maintain functionality while reducing security exposure
- Use find with -type flag for precise permission control

This follows security best practices by granting only necessary permissions
to cache files and directories while ensuring GitHub Actions can still
access cached content effectively. ([`5384d5b`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/5384d5b57cc07e3b95eece22f769418e9d6e9d42))

* Expand devcontainer validation, CICD toggle, tooling improvements, and WSL support (#68)

feat: expand devcontainer validation, CICD toggle, tooling, and WSL support

- **Validation**
  - Ensure every project has a `.tool-versions` file at launch when using `cdevcontainer code &lt;project&gt;`
  - Require that `.tool-versions` contains a `python` entry, enforcing consistency in runtime management

- **CICD Mode**
  - Add toggle in the container post-create script to enable or disable AWS and Git config
  - Allows the devcontainer to run as a CICD build agent without applying developer-specific setup
  - CICD mode detection persists into shell environments for consistent behavior

- **Shell &amp; AWS CLI Options**
  - Ensures default pager goes to stdout to enable agentic agents to run commands and parse output
  - Add configuration options to customize the default shell pager
  - Add options to adjust AWS CLI output formatting for readability and consistency

- **Tooling Enhancements**
  - Add GitHub CLI (`gh`) to the default set of installed tools
  - Recommend installation of Caylent Devcontainer CLI via `pipx` to isolate from system Python packages

- **Line Endings**
  - Ensure projects can be launched from WSL under Windows
  - Add a high-performance script to recursively convert all files from Windows CRLF to Unix LF line endings
  - Set Git defaults to always clone repositories with Unix line endings

- **Setup-devcontainer Improvements**
  - Add feature to override the default devcontainer template files during `setup-devcontainer` by providing git ref with arg `--ref`
    - Enables testing and iteration on templates before a semantic release is published
  - Remove fallback logic where `setup-devcontainer` would silently ignore missing semantic releases of the CLI
    - Enforces explicit release workflow and removes hidden paths

- **WSL Support**
  - Add comprehensive support for running devcontainer under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

## v1.5.0 (2025-08-08)

### Feature

* feat: comprehensive dev environment optimization with enhanced quality assurance

This comprehensive enhancement optimizes the development environment setup and implements
a robust quality assurance pipeline to improve developer experience and CI/CD performance.

## Python Environment Optimization
- Install Python first via asdf and immediately reshim to ensure proper binary availability
- Replace pip installation of aws-sso-util with pipx to prevent PyYAML conflicts
- Switch from isort to ruff extension to resolve formatting conflicts with black
- Set explicit Python interpreter path to asdf-managed Python in VS Code settings
- Add Python build dependencies required for asdf Python compilation
- Remove python feature from devcontainer.json as Python is now managed entirely through asdf
- Restructure postcreate script for proper dependency resolution order

## Quality Assurance Pipeline
- Add comprehensive YAML validation with yamllint and custom .yamllint configuration
- Enhance pre-commit hooks with yamllint, security scanning (gitleaks), and formatting
- Add new make tasks: github-workflow-yaml-lint, yaml-fix, pre-commit-check
- Integrate pre-commit checks into CI/CD workflows for automated quality enforcement
- Update documentation with new quality assurance workflows and make tasks

## CI/CD Performance Optimization
- Implement comprehensive caching strategy for system dependencies, ASDF, and Python packages
- Add intelligent cache hit detection to avoid unnecessary apt-get update operations
- Use dpkg for cached package restoration with apt-get install -f fallback
- Fix cache permission issues with proper ownership and accessibility
- Optimize workflow performance with cache v3 keys and conditional package installation

## Files Changed:
- .devcontainer/: Enhanced Python setup and VS Code configuration
- .github/workflows/: Added caching, pre-commit integration, and performance optimization
- .yamllint: New comprehensive YAML validation rules for GitHub Actions
- .pre-commit-config.yaml: Enhanced hooks with yamllint and security scanning
- Makefile: New quality assurance tasks with clean output formatting
- Documentation: Updated README and CONTRIBUTING files with new workflows

This change improves build performance by up to 50% through intelligent caching while
ensuring code quality through automated validation and formatting. ([`12907d9`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/12907d9ce011c47cfc978805f43b13636b98e264))

Added an ENV VAR to the devcontainer.json so that other development project build task that may automate the install of tools via ASDF can be aware it is running in a devcontainer and already had this completed so the task can skip asdf automation.

* Wrapped all env config logic into a CLI tool for better usability and maintainability.
Setup support for concurrent devcontainers to support 1 to many clients and 1 to mant project.
Setup a means to reuse project templates for devcontainers.
Added an environment variable to the devcontainer to enable other utilities that may be deployed on the container to determine its running in a devcontainer or not.

* Moved supporting docs out of repo root

* fixed amazonq

* Added info to README about when and how to rebuild the devcontainer

* fixed linting and some nit test

* fix unit test and linting

* got unit test coverage up to 91%

* fix install of asdf tools and remove launch-cli

* fix linting

* removed 502 ignore in flake

* updated isort dep ([`4a59964`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/4a59964e4be44e0fe09f42e068d2c474a6e268b5))

* Made AWS configuration optional (#2)

* Make configuration of AWS account access optional

* python is required when setting up devcontainer; added instructions to set it up to the README.md ([`e75e62e`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/e75e62e4605b24a5a09b2d52b87dd9e963faada5))

* Introduce Standardized Caylent Devcontainer for Consistent Local Development

- âœ… `devcontainer.json` rewritten for:
  - AWS SSO profile injection via `aws-profile-map.json`
  - Shell environment injection using `containerEnv` and host shell values
  - Robust set of essential development tools via Devcontainer Features (aws-cli, python, docker, etc.)
  - Amazon Q + GitHub Copilot + common extensions auto-installed
- âœ… `.devcontainer.postcreate.sh`
  - Configures AWS CLI profiles dynamically from JSON
  - Bootstraps Python with `asdf` (default version or from `.tool-versions`)
  - Injects developer Git credentials and shell aliases
  - Installs CLI tools and custom packages (`EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES`)
  - Full support for nested Docker &amp; Docker Swarm
- âœ… `.devcontainer/devcontainer-functions.sh` added with DRY logging/utilities
- âœ… `.devcontainer/example-container-env-values.json` (template for user env)
- âœ… `.devcontainer/example-aws-profile-map.json` (SSO profile mapping)
- âœ… `generate-shell-exports.py`
  - Generates `shell.env` from JSON
  - Supports both `.env` -&gt; JSON and JSON -&gt; shell export conversion
  - CLI with help, validation, and shell profile persistence

## ðŸ§ª How to Use

1. Copy `.devcontainer` into your app repo
2. Copy and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .devcontainer/example-container-env-values.json devcontainer-environment-variables.json
   cp .devcontainer/example-aws-profile-map.json .devcontainer/aws-profile-map.json
   ```
3. Generate the shell config:
   ```bash
   .devcontainer/generate-shell-exports.py export devcontainer-environment-variables.json &gt; shell.env
