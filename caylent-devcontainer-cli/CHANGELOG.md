# CHANGELOG



## v1.6.0 (2025-08-08)

### Chore

* chore: add comprehensive caching to PyPI publish workflow (#61)

* optimize: add comprehensive caching to PyPI publish workflow

- Add system dependencies cache with intelligent dpkg restoration
- Add ASDF installation cache with conditional clone logic
- Add Python dependencies cache for pip and site-packages
- Implement cache hit detection and permission fixing
- Optimize workflow performance by ~2-3 minutes
- Reduce bandwidth usage and improve reliability

These caching optimizations mirror the strategy used in main-validation.yml
and provide significant performance improvements for both manual and
automatic PyPI publishing workflows.

* chore: remove redundant source command ([`6f4ad11`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/6f4ad1117ccd47beb6afa8000ab21084d3f7bf5a))

### Feature

* feat: add manual trigger capability to publish workflow

- Add workflow_dispatch trigger to publish.yml for manual PyPI publishing
- Support both automatic (tag push) and manual (workflow dispatch) triggers
- Add dynamic tag detection and version consistency across all steps
- Enable manual publishing of any existing tag (e.g., 1.5.0)
- Fix kebab-case linting issue with skip-existing parameter
- Keep semantic-release PyPI upload disabled for controlled publishing ([`d2c4bba`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/d2c4bba1fe676024b75fdafae118f58f94b772a6))

### Fix

* fix: resolve semantic-release version synchronization issues in CI/CDâ€¦ (#63)

* fix: resolve semantic-release version synchronization issues in CI/CD workflows

- Fix main-validation workflow to properly update all version files (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CHANGELOG.md)
- Use &#39;semantic_release version --no-push --no-vcs-release&#39; instead of just &#39;changelog&#39; command
- Add comprehensive version file commits to prevent version mismatches
- Replace manual version overrides in publish workflow with version consistency verification
- Update CHANGELOG.md to properly reflect current v1.5.0 release
- Ensures git tags point to commits with synchronized version files across all locations

This prevents the &#39;already released&#39; error by maintaining proper version file synchronization
and ensures semantic-release can correctly calculate next versions from commit history.

* fix: improve workflow comments and version parsing precision

- Clarify semantic-release comment to specify which files are updated (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, CHANGELOG.md)
- Use line-start anchored regex for pyproject.toml version parsing to avoid false matches
- Add detailed comments explaining Python regex approach vs grep/sed limitations
- Ensures robust version detection that handles both quote types and prevents pattern conflicts

* fix: clean up trailing whitespace in publish workflow

- Remove trailing whitespace automatically fixed by pre-commit hooks
- Ensures consistent code formatting across workflow files ([`f593565`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/f593565c7fe563b0a6f6a4d5d5b0ade936ae3e60))

* fix: optimize PyPI publish workflow with comprehensive caching and enhanced semantic versioning (#62)

* optimize: add comprehensive caching to PyPI publish workflow

- Add system dependencies cache with intelligent dpkg restoration
- Add ASDF installation cache with conditional clone logic
- Add Python dependencies cache for pip and site-packages
- Implement cache hit detection and permission fixing
- Optimize workflow performance by ~2-3 minutes
- Reduce bandwidth usage and improve reliability

These caching optimizations mirror the strategy used in main-validation.yml
and provide significant performance improvements for both manual and
automatic PyPI publishing workflows.

* chore: remove redundant source command

* fix: expand conventional commit support with comprehensive type definitions

- Add support for &#39;security&#39; and &#39;revert&#39; commit types as patch triggers
- Add comprehensive conventional commit documentation to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Include examples and version bump mapping for all supported types
- Clarify major version bump procedures with BREAKING CHANGE examples

This enables better semantic versioning automation and provides clear
guidelines for contributors on commit message formatting.

* fix: improve cache key robustness across all GitHub workflows

- Replace hardcoded &#39;ubuntu-2404&#39; with dynamic runner.arch in cache keys
- Ensures cache compatibility across different GitHub runner architectures
- Affects publish.yml, pr-validation.yml, and main-validation.yml workflows
- Prevents potential cache misses when GitHub updates runner specifications

This addresses the mismatch between runs-on: ubuntu-24.04 and hardcoded
ubuntu-2404 in cache keys, making the caching strategy more resilient.

* security: improve cache directory permissions with principle of least privilege

- Replace overly permissive chmod -R 755 with granular permissions
- Set directories to 755 (executable/searchable) and files to 644 (read-only)
- Apply security improvements across all workflows: publish.yml, main-validation.yml, pr-validation.yml
- Maintain functionality while reducing security exposure
- Use find with -type flag for precise permission control

This follows security best practices by granting only necessary permissions
to cache files and directories while ensuring GitHub Actions can still
access cached content effectively. ([`5384d5b`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/5384d5b57cc07e3b95eece22f769418e9d6e9d42))

* fix: apply pre-commit trailing whitespace fixes to publish workflow ([`2bba852`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/2bba85264c67b98e28f247d774cb535ebaeb5664))


## v1.5.0 (2025-08-08)

### Feature

* feat: comprehensive dev environment optimization with enhanced quality assurance

This comprehensive enhancement optimizes the development environment setup and implements
a robust quality assurance pipeline to improve developer experience and CI/CD performance.

## Python Environment Optimization
- Install Python first via asdf and immediately reshim to ensure proper binary availability
- Replace pip installation of aws-sso-util with pipx to prevent PyYAML conflicts
- Switch from isort to ruff extension to resolve formatting conflicts with black
- Set explicit Python interpreter path to asdf-managed Python in VS Code settings
- Add Python build dependencies required for asdf Python compilation
- Remove python feature from devcontainer.json as Python is now managed entirely through asdf
- Restructure postcreate script for proper dependency resolution order

## Quality Assurance Pipeline
- Add comprehensive YAML validation with yamllint and custom .yamllint configuration
- Enhance pre-commit hooks with yamllint, security scanning (gitleaks), and formatting
- Add new make tasks: github-workflow-yaml-lint, yaml-fix, pre-commit-check
- Integrate pre-commit checks into CI/CD workflows for automated quality enforcement
- Update documentation with new quality assurance workflows and make tasks

## CI/CD Performance Optimization
- Implement comprehensive caching strategy for system dependencies, ASDF, and Python packages
- Add intelligent cache hit detection to avoid unnecessary apt-get update operations
- Use dpkg for cached package restoration with apt-get install -f fallback
- Fix cache permission issues with proper ownership and accessibility
- Optimize workflow performance with cache v3 keys and conditional package installation

## Files Changed:
- .devcontainer/: Enhanced Python setup and VS Code configuration
- .github/workflows/: Added caching, pre-commit integration, and performance optimization
- .yamllint: New comprehensive YAML validation rules for GitHub Actions
- .pre-commit-config.yaml: Enhanced hooks with yamllint and security scanning
- Makefile: New quality assurance tasks with clean output formatting
- Documentation: Updated README and CONTRIBUTING files with new workflows

This change improves build performance by up to 50% through intelligent caching while
ensuring code quality through automated validation and formatting. ([`12907d9`](https://github.com/caylent-solutions/devcontainer/commit/12907d9ce011c47cfc978805f43b13636b98e264))
