# [S2.1.2] IAM OIDC & Role Setup

## Work Unit Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | Story |
| **Number** | S2.1.2 |
| **Status** | in-queue |
| **Parent** | F2.1 — ECR Infrastructure |
| **Epic** | E2 — ECR Public Image Mirror |

## Description

Create the IAM OIDC identity provider for GitHub Actions and an IAM role with least-privilege permissions for pushing images to ECR Public. This enables GitHub Actions to authenticate via OIDC without long-lived AWS credentials. This is infrastructure setup done via AWS CLI commands.

## Definition of Ready

- S2.1.1 must be complete (need ACCOUNT_ID and repository ARN)

## Full Requirements

### IAM OIDC Provider for GitHub Actions

- Create IAM OIDC identity provider for GitHub Actions:
  - Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
  - Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`
- Enables GitHub Actions to assume IAM roles without long-lived AWS credentials

### IAM Role for GitHub Actions

- Create IAM role: `github-actions-ecr-public-push` (or per Caylent naming conventions)
- Trust policy: restrict to this specific GitHub repository and workflow's branch

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": { "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com" },
      "StringLike": { "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:caylent-solutions/<REPO_NAME>:ref:refs/heads/main" }
    }
  }]
}
```

- Permissions policy (least privilege — ECR Public push only):
  - `ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken`, `BatchCheckLayerAvailability`, `InitiateLayerUpload`, `UploadLayerPart`, `CompleteLayerUpload`, `PutImage`, `DescribeImages`, `DescribeRepositories` on the specific repository ARN
  - `ecr-public:GetAuthorizationToken` and `sts:GetServiceBearerToken` on Resource: `"*"`

### Security Best Practices

- No long-lived credentials — OIDC only
- Least privilege IAM — only push to specific repo
- Trust policy scoped to this repo's main branch

### Key Notes

- This is infrastructure setup done via AWS CLI commands
- The role ARN discovered here is required by the GitHub Actions workflow story (S2.2.1)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] IAM OIDC identity provider created for GitHub Actions
- [ ] Provider URL and audience configured correctly
- [ ] IAM role created with correct name
- [ ] Trust policy scoped to this specific repo and main branch
- [ ] Permissions policy has least-privilege ECR Public push actions
- [ ] Role ARN documented for GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] No long-lived AWS credentials anywhere
- [ ] Verified: role can be assumed from GitHub Actions (test with dry run if possible)
- [ ] Linting and formatting pass (`make lint && make format`)
- [ ] Pre-commit check passes (`cd caylent-devcontainer-cli && make test && make lint && cd .. && make pre-commit-check`)

## General Code Requirements

### Core Coding Principles

#### Fail-Fast Philosophy

- Never introduce fallback logic of any kind
- Never hard code configuration values
- Never allow operations to fail silently
- All failures must fail fast, exit with non-zero exit code, and surface clear, actionable error messages

#### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class/method should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Create focused, role-specific interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions, not concretions

#### DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Never duplicate code or logic
- Extract common logic into reusable methods, classes, or utilities
- Use inheritance, composition, or delegation to share behavior
- If you write the same logic twice, refactor it into a shared component

#### 12-Factor App Principles

- **Codebase:** One codebase in version control, many deploys
- **Dependencies:** Explicitly declare and isolate all dependencies
- **Config:** Store config in environment variables, never in code
- **Backing Services:** Treat as attached resources, swappable without code changes
- **Build, Release, Run:** Strictly separate stages
- **Processes:** Execute as stateless processes
- **Port Binding:** Export services via port binding (configurable via env vars)
- **Concurrency:** Scale out via process model
- **Disposability:** Fast startup, graceful shutdown
- **Dev/Prod Parity:** Keep environments similar
- **Logs:** Treat as event streams to stdout/stderr
- **Admin Processes:** Run as one-off processes with same codebase

#### Idiomatic Code

- Follow conventions, patterns, and best practices of the specific technology
- Use language-specific idioms and patterns
- Prefer framework-provided solutions over custom implementations

#### Declarative vs Imperative Code

- State descriptions must be declarative (describe **what**), not imperative (describe **how**)
- Use declarative configuration files, IaC, database schemas
- Avoid procedural scripts for infrastructure changes

#### Environment-Agnostic Artifacts

- Build once, deploy anywhere
- No environment-specific code or configuration in artifacts
- All environment-specific configuration injected at runtime
- Never build separate artifacts per environment

#### Input-Driven and Dynamic Configuration

- All code must be input-driven and dynamically configured, not static
- Never use hard-coded values for: URLs, credentials, timeouts, file paths, environment settings, feature flags, test data, port numbers, dates, identifiers
- Externalize all configuration via environment variables or configuration files
- Make all thresholds, limits, and boundaries configurable

### Testing Standards

#### Real Tests Only — No Stubs

- Never create stub tests that always pass
- Tests must validate actual behavior, not mock success
- Tests must be able to fail if code is wrong
- No placeholder tests marked with TODO
- Integration tests must test real integrations (test containers/databases)

### Security Standards

#### Security Scans

- Never add code exceptions to bypass security scan failures without explicit human permission
- Never use `// nosec`, `# noqa`, or `@SuppressWarnings("security")` without approval
- If scan fails: document, analyze, fix code (don't suppress), ask human if false positive

#### Sensitive Data Handling

- Never log, display, or expose: passwords, API keys, SSN, credit cards, PII, tokens, encryption keys
- Use AWS Secrets Manager/Parameter Store for secrets
- Never commit secrets to git
- Mask/redact sensitive data in logs
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

- Validate all user input: type, length, format, range
- Use allowlists, not denylists
- Reject invalid input, don't fix it
- Sanitize for SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Never trust any input from users, APIs, or external systems

#### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement proper session management with secure cookies
- Use strong password policies
- Use OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for API auth
- Implement RBAC
- JWT: short expiration, refresh mechanisms, RS256 signing
- Regenerate session IDs after auth, implement timeout, secure HTTP-only cookies

#### Cryptography

- Use TLS 1.2+ for all network communication
- Use AES-256 for data at rest
- Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for password hashing (never MD5, SHA1, plain SHA256)
- Never implement custom crypto algorithms
- Never store encryption keys in code

#### API Security

- Implement rate limiting
- Validate Content-Type headers
- Implement CORS policies (never wildcard origins in production)
- Return generic error messages
- Implement request size limits
- Required response headers: `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Content-Security-Policy`

#### SQL Injection Prevention

- Use parameterized queries exclusively
- Never concatenate user input into SQL queries
- Use named parameters in native queries

#### XSS Prevention

- Escape all output by default
- Use templating engines with auto-escaping
- Implement Content Security Policy headers
- Use context-aware encoding

#### Container Security

- Run containers as non-root user
- Use minimal base images (distroless when possible)
- Implement resource limits
- Use read-only file systems where possible
- Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities

#### Error Handling and Logging

- Log security-relevant events with timestamps, user IDs, actions
- Never log sensitive data
- Never return stack traces or detailed errors to clients
- Use generic error messages for authentication failures

### Waiting and Readiness Detection

#### Time-Based Delays Are Prohibited

- Never use `sleep` to wait for anything
- Never use time-based delays as synchronization

#### Required: Active Readiness Detection

- Use health check endpoints, port availability checks, file existence, API status polling, process state monitoring, container readiness probes
- All waits must support variable-driven timeouts (no hard-coded values)
- On timeout: fail fast, non-zero exit code, clear diagnostic message

### Shell and Scripting Standards

#### Script Creation Policy

- Never create shell scripts unless explicitly requested by the prompt
- Shell code must not be embedded in application code, CI/CD pipelines, or build logic

#### Prohibited Patterns

- Never use `sleep` commands or sleep-based methods
- Prefer event-driven logic, state polling with conditions, lifecycle hooks, built-in readiness mechanisms
